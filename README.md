### Readme instructions for Analysis of the Migration Range of the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla) from 2004 to 2024
First, read through my portfolio post for a general understanding of the goals and results of this analysis. 

Next, visit my download notebooks (eg. labeled download-2004.ipynb) to understand the data download, processing, and normalization steps.

Finally, visit the "final-project.ipynb" to run the final code to make the year-to-year migration map for comparing range over time. 

Next steps could involve applying this analysis to another species. The code in these notebooks should likely work for other species if you specify a new species to download in the download notebooks.
